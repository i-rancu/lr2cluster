*Cluster identification using multiple data sources*


Welcome to the introduction of `lr2cluster` project! The project aims to help identify cluster assignment of a disease using multiple data sources when some direct methods, such as contact tracing and genome sequencing are only available for some partially observed data.

This page is dedicated as a tutorial and complimentary of paper

Kurnia Susvitasari, Paul Tupper, Irving Cancino-Munoz, Mariana G. Lopez, Inaki Comas, Caroline Colijn
